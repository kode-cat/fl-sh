This is a placeholder file to ensure the icons directory is created.

For a real implementation, you would need to create actual PNG icons in the following sizes:
- 72x72
- 96x96
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 152x152
- 192x192
- 384x384
- 512x512

You can use online tools like:
1. https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/
2. https://www.pwabuilder.com/
3. https://maskable.app/editor

Or for testing, you can use placeholder services like:
